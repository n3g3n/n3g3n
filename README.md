### Hi there 👋

My name is **Igor** and this is my ✨ _special_ ✨ repository where I will meet you with me.

- I've have a collection of cool project where I feel people will like it. In my profile you will find optimization scripts, websites and tutorials.
- My favorite text editor for programming is **kakoune**
- My alternative favorite text editor is Atom.io (Atom will be archived on December 15, 2022 🥲 )
- I'm using Gnu / Linux from 2005, so almost 17 years.
- 🍕 Love Pizza <a class="suppoprt-me" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/igavelyuk" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.buymeacoffee.com/button-api/?text=Buy me a Coffee&nbsp&emoji=&slug=igavel&button_colour=8d7b19&font_colour=fafa8f&font_family=Cookie&outline_colour=acff37&coffee_colour=567d71"></a>
